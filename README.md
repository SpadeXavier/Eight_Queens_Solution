# Eight_Queens_Solution

## The Problem 
From wikipedia: 
>The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Structure of Code 
The code is laid out in 3 files 
- **chess.py:** contains the chessboard class which can be instantiated and manipulated to simulate moves on a chessboard. 
- **simulation.py:** uses the chessboard class to run simulations to solve the problem of placing eight queens with none threatening each other 
- **main.py:** uses the simulation class as well as the python GUI package Kivy to visually represent all solutions possible 

## Running the Code 
Simply download the repository and run main.py   
*NOTE: Ensure you have the kivy python package downloaded*
